# Lecturio-Status-Scraping
A little tool to check whether or not some user has finished a course or not


This script resulted in one of my many jobs at the DSC at the University of LÃ¼beck, which are providing their online courses using Lecturio. Due to the fact that the website offered no automatic checking of alumni, I started writing my own scraping tool using python and beautiful soup. This script is openly usable by anyone, note that you will need admin permissions in your lecturio and that this script uses the german urls, if lecturio is offered in other countries you might need to edit the hardcoded links.

This script is by no means perfect and is meant as a small fun exercise
